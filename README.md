###BERT for Finance
Using BERT and LSTM to classify finance news

Through the use of natural language processing (NLP), we can analyze financial news and gauge market sentiment. In the past, teams of human specialists could manually evaluate the volume of textual data, but more recently, the expansion has been insurmountable, necessitating the use of NLP to solve the issue. This project will cover a variety of NLP approaches, from the most basic to the most sophisticated, and conduct sentiment analysis on stock market news, classifying it as either **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
